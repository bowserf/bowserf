### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- Android lover since I got my first smartphone running [Gingerbread](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_Gingerbread), I started Android development in 2014. 
- For me, there is no better job than being a developer. With just a computer, you can build approximately everything. You just need to learn stuff. There is no dependency on material things. The only limitation is your imagination to invent new things!
- I spend some time making iOS development to know the difference (tools, project structure, language, environment).
- Currently learning to make Gradle works for me instead of being afraid to interact with it.

Presently, I'm working at [MWM](https://mwm.io/), developing an ecosystem of "creative" apps that interact together to unleash people's creativity.
